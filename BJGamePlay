BlackJack game play will occur according to the recommended playing rules.  
Cards will be dealt 1 to the player, 1 to the dealer, 1 to the player, 1 to the dealer.  
For now we will just have one player against the dealer.  In the future it would be helpful to see what happens if we play more than one hand at a time.
The second dealer card will be used to determine what the player should do and we will use the basic strategy.

Player turns will continue until the player stands or busts 
The dealer will hit on anything less than 17
After cards are dealt the result will be determined and the bet will be updated 
In the case of a Blackjack for the player they will be paid 3:2 on the bet 
If the dealer gets blackjack and the player does not then the player loses and we move to the next hand 

If the player has to Split then a new hand will be created and a new bet for that hand 
An array of player hands will be created
The bet object will be split as well but will be combined into one amount after all hands are evaluated

After each round is completed - the cards must be put into the Discard array.

Basic Strategy to be used:
1. Dealer showing 2-6 
   Player hand total  12-16
   Player will stand and let the dealer bust 

2. Always Split Aces and 8's 

3. Never split 10's 

4. Always double down on 11 

5. Double down on 10 when the dealer has A-9 showing 

6. Split 7's when the dealer has 2-7 showing
