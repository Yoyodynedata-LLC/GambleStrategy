BlackJack game play will occur according to the recommended playing rules.  
Cards will be dealt 1 to the player, 1 to the dealer, 1 to the player, 1 to the dealer.  
For now we will just have one player against the dealer.  In the future it would be helpful to see what happens if we play more than one hand at a time.
The second dealer card will be used to determine what the player should do and we will use the basic strategy.

An array will be create to contain the players hands 
each player hand will consist of multiple cards, the hand total, the amount bet and result 
   method for taking a hit 
   method for removing 1 card -  used for splits 
   method for totalling the cards returns results 
   Method for increasing betAmt 

betAmt will be specified by a parameter 

dealerHand object will consist of multiple cards, the hand total
   method for taking a hit 
   method for totalling the cards returns results 

create a playerHand object
playerHand.increaseBet (betAmt)

create a dealerHand object 

deal 1 card to player
deal 1 card to dealer
deal second card to player 
deal second card to dealer 
dealerUpCard = second dealer card 

 check for dealer blackjack
   Y - check for player blackjack 
      playerHand.result = push
      playerHand.result = loss       
  N - call processHand (currentHand, dealerUpCard)


# ****************************************************** #
processHand (playerHand, dealerUpCard)

processHand 
 Step 1 - check for player blackjack 
   playerHand.result = win 
   return
   
Step 2- check for player split hand 
   Y - create a second hand 
      secondHand.increaseBet(betAmt)
      retrieve 1 card from currentHand
      Add card to secondHand
      add secondHand to array of playerHands
      currentHand.takeAHit 
      processHand(currentHand)
      secondHand.takeAHit
      processHand(secondHand)
      return


Step 3 - check for player double down 
   Y - playerHand.increaseBet(betAmt)
       add 1 card to currentHand 
       return 

Step 4 
  nextMove = ''
  while nextMove <> stand
     nextMove = checkStrategy(playerHand, dealerUpCard)
     if nextMove = hit 
            currentHand.takeAHit 

return 

dealerHand 
  while (dealerHand.total < 17) 
     dealerHand.takeAHit 
  return 

Basic Strategy to be used:
1. Dealer showing 2-6 
   Player hand total  12-16
   Player will stand and let the dealer bust 

2. Always Split Aces and 8's 

3. Never split 10's 

4. Always double down on 11 

5. Double down on 10 when the dealer has A-9 showing 

6. Split 7's when the dealer has 2-7 showing
